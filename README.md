- Use STB for textures, fonts, sounds...
- Add Script Engine for [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/integrating.html) or for [JavaScript](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/scripting/prog_guide/api.html).
- Rewrite all the engine in Kotlin.
- Rewrite shaders and lighting system.
- Use OpenCL for some computations.
